  <header>You don't have to watch Donald&nbsp;Trump on the&nbsp;news.</header>
  <div class="body">
  	<p>Unlike most presidents in our lifetime, there is almost no correlation between his actual political beliefs and his inflammatory rhetoric. He's a <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/on-bullshit/oclc/56632137">bullshit artist.</a></p>

    <p>Watching him won't make you a more informed citizen. So,&nbsp;don't.</p>
    
    <p>In conclusion: just don't watch.</p>
